### Live Demo Project [here](https://advice-generator-app-frontendmentor-a.netlify.app/)


If you want to try this app  
1- clone the repository


    https://github.com/Arirockdev/advice-generator-app.git

  2- open the `index.html` file in your browser


## For the app I used:

- Html 

- Css

- Javascript  
To handle the printing of the quote in the dom, I have used an asynchronous function, which handles the request to the api `https://api.adviceslip.com/`. One function that handles the printing of the quotes in the dom and another function that handles any possible errors.
In this way I have modularized the code in a simple and orderly way for better reading.
